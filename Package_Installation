For mac users:
  Open terminal and follow the steps.
    On OS X, install PortAudio using Homebrew: brew install portaudio.  
    Then, install PyAudio using Pip: pip3 install PyAudio.
    Install Urllib to run threads by using: pip install urllib3
    Then you have to install SpeechRecognition using: pip3 install SpeechRecognition.
    
    Since I am using an google API install: pip3 install google-api-python-client
                                            pip install search-google 
                                            pip install google-search
                                            pip3 install google
    Since Google API needs an extension to install another module: pip3 install beautifulsoup4
  
  For Google search:
    Install library by: pip3 install google.
 
*Note: pip3 for python3.
